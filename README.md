# Freebox Remote CLI

## RATIONALE

Where's that damn remote? I have no clue. So I use my terminal to switch
channels... and you should too :-)

## USAGE

    git clone https://github.com/franckverrot/freebox_remote_cli.git
    bundle
    # edit files located in the config directory...
    rake

## TODO

- [ ] Fix channel numbers
- [ ] Make sure this works on both Freebox and CanalSatellite's menus
- [ ] Make this repo a gem
- [ ] Code gardening
- [ ] Stop watching TV, it's beautiful outside
